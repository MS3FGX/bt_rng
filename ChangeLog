06/23/12:
	Removed TODO
	Updated Makefile

04/22/10: Released as Version 2.1
	Minor code and documentation changes to bring in line with other apps
	Checked to see if running as root (why didn't I think of that before?)
	Changed error message to show unsupported device
	Changed "help" text

04/02/10:
	Fixed argument handling bug which prevented -h from working
	Minor documentation changes

03/10/10: Released as Version 2.0
	Completed tests on new algorithm
	Updated documentation

03/09/10:
	Adjusted for zero skew
	Added binary output, made new default

03/03/10:
	Tests of new algorithm
	Rewrite README

02/27/10:
	Fixed compiler warnings from unused functions.
	Added "verbose" status output (-v)

02/16/10:
	Added check to see if given iterations can be distributed evenly

02/14/10:
	Started algorithm rewrite, tested new output mode.
	Removed itoa from Lukás Chmela, dropped back down to GPLv2

12/13/09: Released as Version 1.1
	Added TODO
	Fixed a few wrong exit codes
	Changed default behavior to show help screen

11/17/09:
	Removed unused code

11/12/09:
	Minor documentation changes

11/07/09: Released as Version 1.0
	Updated Makefile
	Minor bug fixes
	In mode 3, threads will now output how many digits they tossed out.

11/05/09:
	Removed all original functions from bccmd not used in bt_rng. Reduced
	binary size from 76K to 16K.
	Fixed file access glitch.
	Initial tests on PPC. Compiles, but behaves strangely. Investigating.

11/04/09:
	Changed iteration counter to unsigned long, to prevent overflow on
	long runs.

11/02/09:
	Added weighted binary output mode to take into account bias in CSR
	PRNG. High quality numbers, very slow.
	Added counter to record number of discarded bits.

11/01/09:
	Fixed bug where bt_rng would end unexpectedly if time difference
	between threads was too high. Allows for runs past 2 million
	iterations.
	
10/31/09:
	Increased maximum threads to 4 (unstable, but works).
	Added true binary output mode through C version of itoa by Lukás
	Chmela.

10/30/09:
	First multithreaded version. Supports 2 threads.
	Many bug fixes and cleanup.
	Added interpreted binary output mode.
	
10/28/09:
	First test. Modified bccmd to loop cmd_rand
